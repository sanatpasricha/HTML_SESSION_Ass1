<p> France’s foreign minister is pulling together an urgent international meeting for a stabilisation plan for Mosul as the push to free the city from the Islamic State group advances.

<p> Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said on Tuesday that he and his Iraqi counterpart, Ibrahim a-Jaafari, would gather more than 20 countries and international organisations to come up with a plan to protect civilians, distribute aid and address questions about governing areas newly liberated by the Islamic State group.

<p>

The tension between Mr. Trump and Ms. Clinton was palpable from the start of their 90-minute debate. The two U.S. presidential nominees set off the event with several personal attacks in the light of Mr. Trump's leaked tapes. The first sign of the escalating tension: no handshake as they met at centre stage.
</p>



<p>
Plunging right into the heated topic, Mr. Trump was asked to comment on the tapes that were leaked on Friday. The real estate mogul denied that he never kissed and grabbed women without their consent. The Republican nominee said that "it was just locker room talk and he was not proud of it." He argued that his crude words from a newly released video paled in comparison to what he called Bill Clinton’s abuse of women.
